# python-example
This is a python script for creating a database, blockchains, and inerting a few data points. It's meant to demonstrate the usage of the python database driver.

## getting the driver
You'll need python and pip to run:

`python -m pip install mdb-bp`

## modify the database credentials and address
Where we create our connection, you'll have to modify the `username`, `password` and `serverAddress`
